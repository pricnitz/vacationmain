                <p class="textthree">Sri Lanka is an ideal destination for South Indians to explore and enjoy. Nestled in the Indian Ocean, just beneath India, the country has a rich history, culture, and stunning natural beauty, making it a must-visit destination.</p>

It is best to schedule your visit outside of these times.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 headingthree">Visa Requirements and Entry Procedures</h2>
                <p class="textthree">If you are considering a trip to Sri Lanka from South India, the country provides a handy Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) system. Apply online and expect approval within 24 hours. The ETA allows you to stay for 30 days, with the option to extend it for up to six months. Alternatively, you can apply for a visa at a Sri Lankan embassy or consulate in India; however, it is advised that you apply at least two weeks in advance.</p>
                <p class="textthree">Ensure your passport is valid for at least six months after you arrive in Sri Lanka. When you arrive, be prepared to show your passport, ETA or visa, and return ticket. If you are travelling with children under 16, remember their birth certificates.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 headingthree">Cultural Connections with South India</h2>
                <p class="textthree">Not only is a trip to Sri Lanka from South India a chance to see another nation, but it’s also an opportunity to learn more about the cultural ties between the two areas. Here are some of the cultural connections that you might expect to see throughout your trip:</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 headingthree">Language and Literature</h2>
                <p class="textthree">Sri Lanka’s national language, Sinhalese, is similar to Tamil, which is extensively spoken in South India. In fact, Tamil is one of Sri Lanka’s official languages, and it is spoken by many people in the country’s north and east regions. Sri Lanka also reveres the literary works of ancient Tamil poets such as Thiruvalluvar and Avvaiyar.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 headingthree">Religious Bonds</h2>
                <p class="textthree">Buddhism, the prevalent religion in Sri Lanka, has its roots in India and bears numerous resemblances with Hinduism. As a result, many Sri Lankan religious ceremonies and practices are similar to those conducted in South India. One example is the common practice of presenting flowers and burning oil lamps at temples in these regions.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 headingthree">Festivals and Celebrations</h2>
                <p class="textthree">Many of Sri Lanka’s festivals have their roots in South India. For example, the Sinhalese New Year, which takes place in April, is similar to the Tamil New Year festivities. In Kandy, the Esala Perahera, a spectacular parade celebrated yearly, pays homage to the Buddha’s Sacred Tooth Relic and is similar to Tamil Nadu’s Theru festival.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 headingthree">Artistic and Architectural Influences</h2>
                <p class="textthree">Sri Lanka’s ancient kingdoms were greatly inspired by South Indian art and architecture. For example, the beautiful rock-cut temples of Dambulla and Sigiriya are strikingly similar to the rock-cut temples of Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu. The elaborate carvings and sculptures in Sri Lanka’s ancient temples are reminiscent of South Indian artistic influences.</p>
