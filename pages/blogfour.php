                        <h1 class="card-title fw-bold heading">IndiGo launches direct flights between Mumbai and Amsterdam</h1>
                        <p class="card-text text-muted small">Updated on May 27, 2025 by Admin</p>
                        <p class="textthree mt-3">India's largest airline by market share IndiGo, is strategically expanding its global network and in line with its plans, the carrier launched direct flights between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai, and Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport on Tuesday (July 1). The new route is the carrier's second long-haul international service, following the commencement of flights to Manchester just a day earlier.</p>

                        <p class="textthree">Operating thrice weekly with Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft, the new Mumbai–Amsterdam route highlights IndiGo's steadfast internationalisation plan titled 'Towards New Heights and across New Frontiers'. It marks a significant stride in the airline's ambition to position itself as a global player and enhance India's connectivity with key global aviation hubs.</p>
                        <p class="textthree">We are committed to delivering a seamless and enhanced experience to our customers at great value, promoting direct traffic between India and Europe. This route will not only enhance connectivity for leisure, business, and student travellers, but deepen thriving partnership between India and the Netherlands— culturally, economically, and diplomatically. In collaboration with Schiphol Airport and other local partners, we look forward to welcoming our customers and providing them a hassle-free and enjoyable flying experience.</p>
                        <p class="textthree">Schiphol Airport is one of the world's busiest aviation hubs and a key European gateway. With this launch, IndiGo aims to facilitate smooth onward connections to Europe, North America and Canada, while offering access to its extensive domestic network of over 90 destinations across India.</p>
                        <p class="textthree">The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, operating under a damp lease agreement with Norse Atlantic Airways, feature a dual-class cabin. The aircraft includes 56 IndiGoStretch premium seats in a 2x3x2 configuration with a spacious 43-inch pitch, and 282 economy class seats in a 3x3x3 layout offering a 31-inch pitch. All seats are equipped with seatback screens featuring up to 300 hours of in-flight entertainment, including a mix of films and TV series..</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-4 fw-bold headingthree">IndiGo launches non-stop flights to Manchester & Amsterdam, expands long-haul operations</h2>
                        <p class="textthree ">Spreading our wings further in Europe, we are delighted to launch our Mumbai–Amsterdam flights, connecting India to the world,” said Pieter Elbers, Chief Executive Officer of IndiGo</p>

                        <p class="textthree">The airline's long-haul operations were initiated earlier this year with the launch of Dreamliner services on the Mumbai–Bangkok route. The long-haul fleet is set to expand with the introduction of Airbus A321XLRs later in 2025 and Airbus A350-900s from 2027 onwards, allowing deeper reach into Europe, Asia, and beyond.</p>
