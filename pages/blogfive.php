                    <p>If you’re planning a trip in August, <strong>Nepal</strong> is the cheapest country to visit from India right now, with budget-friendly flights from Delhi, Kolkata, and other major cities. August is a prime monsoon month across the country, so packing for the weather is key but if you’re not fazed by a bit of rain, you’re in for an experience that’s rich in culture and comfort. The downpour adds a certain charm to Nepal’s historic cities, especially when wandering through the three Durbar Squares of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Patan. Each square offers a glimpse into the country's intricate Newari <strong>architecture</strong>, thriving street life, and delicious food. Don't miss the chance to pick up handmade souvenirs or watch artisans at work. While trekking is off the table during this season due to slippery trails and leech-prone paths (especially if you're eyeing Pokhara, it's better to wait till October), there’s still a lot to savour. Picture yourself curled up indoors with a hot bowl of thukpa, passing around plates of momos with friends as the <strong>monsoon</strong> plays its rhythm on the window sill. If you're feeling hands-on, consider signing up for a cooking class in Kathmandu where you can learn to fold your own momos, start to finish. Between meals, duck into sacred spots like the Swayambhunath Stupa, home to playful monkeys and sweeping views of the valley, or visit the Pashupatinath Temple along the Bagmati River, where rituals offer insight into the spiritual fabric of the country.</p>
